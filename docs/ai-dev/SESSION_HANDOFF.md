# SESSION HANDOFF — Visual Design Workspace / Claude Content Sync

## Project Control
- Repository: `nanpsw-eng/three-kingdoms-mystery-dungeon`
- Current product source: `main` at `4792356fa81f39ca053edc0df30278868abe2c22`
- Latest Claude work: PR #10 merged; Claude commit `3b5bbf3b5b6bfdb7508cca815213da90c4accb5c`
- Art/design branch: `art/ink-graphic-novel-v1`
- Art HEAD before this handoff commit: `34ea4aacd7f68f75b15464bcf40c6878758dca4d`
- Open PR: none
- Art CI before this commit: pending check for `34ea4aacd7f68f75b15464bcf40c6878758dca4d`; prior art CI `f10b206cfe45c2e8ccc4e507d754e65a9f4bb50a` succeeded.
- Art direction and Product Baseline remain unchanged.

## Work Responsibility
This Work owns visual design, concept art, asset registry, and visual QA. The user instructed that all design work continue here without a separate Codex work assignment. Keep the actual game visuals and functional behavior intact while creating design assets and specifications.

## Verified Claude Content Delta
- PR #10 added save compatibility handling, Codex/achievement screens, character historical notes, and line-by-line story scenes; it is merged into main.
- The current Codex view has Characters, Bosses, Achievements, and Items tabs with dynamic progress/total counters.
- Character detail uses a 40px portrait row with class, stats, skills, and historical note.
- Story scene progression includes a 48px speaker portrait, line progress, next/tap, skip, and choices after the final line.
- `docs/art/STORY_ART_QUEUE.md` on main lists 37 added ruler/general designs and about 90 enemy/boss names. Follow stable ids and existing aliases.

## Completed This Session
- Verified main HEAD, art HEAD, Claude branch/PR, Codex screen/scene markup, story art queue, and CI.
- Created and reviewed four character concepts:
  - Sima Yi bust/full-body/exploration token.
  - Liu Bei/Cao Cao/Sun Quan ruler comparison.
  - Dong Zhuo/Lü Bu E2 boss comparison.
- Created and reviewed three UI concepts:
  - Codex character-detail state v2 with data-driven tab fractions.
  - Codex Bosses/Achievements/Items tab-state board.
  - Mid-scene and final-choice story sheet states.
- Saved downscaled concept references and updated the asset registry and Claude visual delta spec in the art branch.

## Asset State
- Global art direction: `APPROVED`.
- Sima Yi master: `CONCEPT`; align with the original ruler master set before approval.
- Liu Bei/Cao Cao/Sun Quan comparison: `CONCEPT`; face/beard, posture, and palette differences established; reduce residual metallic ornament and split into reusable master refs.
- Dong Zhuo/Lü Bu comparison: `CONCEPT`; broad-vs-tall silhouettes established; simplify armor details and verify small tokens.
- Codex character-detail UI: `CONCEPT`; dynamic progress fractions correct, but enlarged art is mood reference and actual code uses a 40px row portrait.
- Codex secondary tab board: `CONCEPT`; visual state language established for campaign-grouped bosses, earned achievements, and identified/unidentified items.
- Story scene UI: `CONCEPT`; reveal and choice states represented; actual portrait must remain 48px and the sheet needs scroll QA.
- Individual production portraits, icon sets, and implementation: not created.
- Repository copies are downscaled JPEG references, not production exports.

## DO_NOT_REPEAT
- Do not reopen A/B/C art direction or recreate the Visual Bible.
- Do not redo PR #10 story/content/engine work.
- Do not alter Codex data, save behavior, story flow, or game rules as visual work.
- Do not mark concept sheets approved or production-ready.
- Keep readable hanji/ink/vermilion surfaces; avoid excess metallic ornament and text-background scenery.

## Verification
- PR #10 report states: `npm test` 156/156 PASS, `build:web` PASS, Chromium 390×844 smoke PASS, page errors 0.
- Prior art docs commit CI succeeded; no code was changed in these design commits.
- Local build/test and production-screen visual QA: `NOT_RUN`.
- Concept images were visually inspected; remaining design gaps are recorded above.

## NEXT_SAFE_ACTION
1. Refine the three original ruler concepts into reusable bust/full-body/token references and reduce metallic ornament.
2. Align Sima Yi to that established ruler master system.
3. Produce standalone art for top-priority campaign bosses and playable generals per `STORY_ART_QUEUE.md`.
4. Continue item-family silhouettes and enemy faction studies.

## HUMAN GATE
- Reversible design exploration and reference/spec updates on the art branch: no additional gate.
- Main merge, production deployment, material product change, or art-direction change: user approval required.
